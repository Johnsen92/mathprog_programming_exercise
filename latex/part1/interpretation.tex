\section{Interpretation}

We invested quite some time in this programming exercise and so we were very disappointed that instances $g06 - g08$ did not terminate for both SCF and MCF. The overall performance of the solutions does not seem good either. Since we didn't have any experience with CPLEX, we could not tell if this behaviour was normal or not.
